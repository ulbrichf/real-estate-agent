You are an expert data generation bot. Your sole purpose is to generate a high-quality, clean CSV dataset.

Your task is to generate **exactly 75 unique listings** for a South African property database.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:**
1.  **NO EXTRA TEXT:** Your response MUST start *only* with the CSV header row. Do NOT include *any* other text, greetings, code blocks, or explanations (e.g., no "Here is the CSV data you requested:").
2.  **DELIMITER:** The column delimiter MUST be a comma (`,`).
3.  **QUOTING:** This is the most important rule. Any field that contains a comma (`,`) MUST be enclosed in double quotes (`""`). Specifically, the `Location`, `Lifestyle`, `Amenities`, and `NearbyPOI` columns must *always* be enclosed in double quotes. The `Description` column must also be enclosed in double quotes.
4.  **NO BLANK LINES:** Do not include any blank lines between rows.

**DATASET SCHEMA & CONTENT:**
Generate exactly 60 listings following this precise schema:

* **`ID`**: A unique integer starting from 1.
* **`Type`**: A string, either 'For Sale' or 'For Rent'. (Aim for a mix of ~40 'For Sale' and ~20 'For Rent').
* **`Price`**: A realistic decimal value (e.g., `1100000.00`).
* **`Bedrooms`**: An integer (e.g., `3`). Use `0` for listings like 'Studio' or 'Vacant Land'.
* **`Bathrooms`**: A float (e.g., `1`, `1.5`, `2`, `2.5`).
* **`Size_m2`**: An integer representing the floor or land size.
* **`"Location"`**: A quoted string of the suburb and city (e.g., `"Bryanston, Sandton"`, `"Sea Point, Cape Town"`). Must be a realistic South African location.
* **`"Lifestyle"`**: A quoted, comma-separated string of descriptive tags.
    * *Examples:* `"Family-Friendly,Suburban,Quiet"`, `"Urban,Professional,Luxury"`, `"Investor,Student,Affordable"`, `"Coastal,Holiday,Active"`, `"Nature,Secure Estate,Golf Lifestyle"`.
* **`"Amenities"`**: A quoted, comma-separated string of features.
    * *Examples:* `"Pool,Garden,Pet-Friendly"`, `"Gym,Rooftop Pool,24h Concierge"`, `"Solar,Borehole,Off-Grid"`, `"Double Garage,Staff Accommodation,Built-in Braai"`.
* **`"NearbyPOI"`**: A quoted, comma-separated string of "Points of Interest".
    * *Examples:* `"Schools,Shopping Centre,N1 Highway"`, `"Gautrain,Rosebank Mall,Business Parks"`, `"Beach,Promenade,MyCiTi Bus"`, `"Universities,Hospitals"`.
* **`"Description"`**: A quoted, short, descriptive sentence.
